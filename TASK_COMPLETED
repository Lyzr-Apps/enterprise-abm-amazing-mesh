MISSION CONTROL DASHBOARD - COMPLETE
=====================================

## What Was Built

A complete real-time Mission Control Dashboard for the Lyzr Outreach Signal-to-Action Engine with:

### 1. Agent IDs Updated (27 Total)
- Original 8 agents: Lead Processing, Enrichment, ICP Scoring, Message Gen, Email, LinkedIn, Scheduler, Style Analyzer
- 7 New agents: Clay, Instantly, LinkedIn Nav, Genspark, Claude, Gemini, Multi-Channel Orchestrator
- 11 NEW Signal-to-Action agents: LinkedIn Signal Listener, Compound Intent Score Manager, Day 0 Strategic Memo, Text-a-Friend Message Writer, Style Vibe Check, Knowledge Graph, Response Classifier, Follow-up Sequence Engine, Global Time-Zone Orchestrator, HubSpot Ghost Writer, Multi-Channel Load Balancer

### 2. Mission Control Features

**THE PULSE HEADER (Top Row):**
- Active Intent Scans card (47 scans) with pulsing Activity icon
- SQL Velocity circular progress (680/1000 target = 68%)
- Agent Health Grid showing 27 agents (25 green, 2 amber)

**3-COLUMN LAYOUT:**

**LEFT: Live Intent Signals**
- 12 realistic intent signals with hot/warm/cold strength
- Color-coded signal cards (red/orange/blue borders)
- "Approve Memo" button triggers 5-agent workflow:
  1. Compound Intent Score Manager evaluates
  2. Day 0 Strategic Memo generated
  3. Text-a-Friend Message Writer creates casual DM
  4. Style Vibe Check validates message
  5. Global Time-Zone Orchestrator schedules delivery
- Signals disappear after processing
- Hot signals have pulsing "Approve Memo" buttons

**CENTER: SQL Funnel Analytics**
- 5-stage funnel: Signals Caught (847) → Qualified (612) → DMs Sent (523) → Replies (341) → SQLs (680)
- Progress bars with percentages
- Drop-off percentages between stages (28%, 15%, 35%, 50%)
- Conversion Leakage Alert card highlighting 35% DM-to-Reply drop

**RIGHT: Performance Insights**
- Top Hook card showing best-performing message template (47% reply rate)
- Top Signal Sources ranked by SQL conversion (Competitor Comments 52%, Job Changes 38%, Hiring Spikes 29%)
- Knowledge Graph preview showing Acme Corp with 7 decision makers, 12 mutual connections, 3 champions

### 3. Navigation & UX
- Sidebar with Mission Control (default), QA Inbox, Settings
- Shows "27 AI Agents Active" in footer
- Dark mode UI (slate-950 base, cyan/purple/red accents)
- NO emojis, NO toast notifications

### 4. Technical Implementation
- Uses `callAIAgent` from `@/utils/aiAgent` for all agent interactions
- TypeScript interfaces for IntentSignal and FunnelStage
- Mock data for 12 intent signals with realistic descriptions
- State management for signal processing (loading states, removal after approval)
- All agent IDs are REAL 24-character hex values from workflow.json

## File Created
- `/app/project/src/pages/Home.tsx` (656 lines, complete replacement)

## Key Design Choices
1. Mission Control is the DEFAULT page (first tab)
2. Signal approval triggers sequential agent workflow (Intent → Memo → Message → Style → Schedule)
3. Hot signals (intent score ≥ 100) get full processing pipeline
4. Signals removed from UI after approval to simulate real-time processing
5. Agent health grid uses visual status indicators (green = healthy, amber = warning)
6. Funnel uses actual Progress components styled with cyan
7. Circular SQL progress uses inline SVG for visual appeal

## Agent Integration
The "Approve Memo" button orchestrates all 5 Signal-to-Action agents:
```typescript
handleApproveSignal →
  COMPOUND_INTENT_SCORE_MANAGER →
  DAY_0_STRATEGIC_MEMO →
  TEXT_A_FRIEND_MESSAGE_WRITER →
  STYLE_VIBE_CHECK →
  GLOBAL_TIME_ZONE_ORCHESTRATOR
```

All responses logged to console for debugging.
